### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I am Hela Talbi

---
I am a passionate student specializing in embedded systems, electronics, IoT, and embedded Linux. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of STM32 through hands-on projects. This year, I discovered the world of Embedded Linux and the Yocto Project, which sparked my interest due to its significant impact on embedded systems. Since then, I have been continuously learning and building my skills in this field.

I am also exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into embedded systems, aiming to develop smart, efficient, and innovative solutions.
